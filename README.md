Basic "To-Do List"-type of application as a project for Code in Place Stanford Introduction to Programming.
The application is not finished but my goal is to further polish it and have it as a long-term hobby project.
Important to note, due to my lack of skills, when saving a new entry to the file, make sure to save each entry (each line that you enter) because the code only takes the last input in the text box and appends it to the file.
