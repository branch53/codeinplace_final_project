Basic project for Code in Place Stanford Introduction to Programming.
The program is a text box widget in which any text can be entered and then saved to a text file. When the program is reopened, the previously saved content in the text file is shown in the text box widget.
The application is not finished but my goal is to further polish it and have it as a long-term hobby project. There are a lot of things to implement.
Important to note, due to my lack of skills, when saving a new entry to the file, make sure to save each entry (each line that you enter) because the code only takes the last input in the text box and appends it to the file.
